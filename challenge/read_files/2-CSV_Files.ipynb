Python strings have a \"join\" method that will join things using the string, so if we write \",\".join((\"jack\",\"jill\",\"pail\")), we will get \"jack,jill,pail\".\n",

    "The proof is on the file system though -- go ahead and find the \"small_data_set.csv\" file, and open it in either an editor or a spreadsheet (or both).  \n",
