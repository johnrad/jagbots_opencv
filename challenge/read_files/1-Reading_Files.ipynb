    "# Reading Files\n",
    "Working with files is a key capability to make use of Python.  Files are the most basic form of \"persistence\".  Persistence is about making data available beyond the life of the script/program you are running. \n",
    "\n",
    "Normally in a computer program, all of the data stored in variables \"goes away\" when the program terminates.  This is because when a program completes, it releases the memory it was using, which is what contained all of the data.\n",
    "\n",
    "To get around this, we can \"write\" the data (store it) to a file on the computer (you can also store data in a database, but that is a topic for a later time...).  When the program terminates, the file remains, and it can be \"opened\" and \"read\" by another script.\n",
    "\n",
    "Before we write a file though, let's see what's it like to read from a file.\n",
    "\n",
    "I have a file with a roster of (fictitious) FRC members.  This file is a \"commas separated values\" or \"csv\" file.  All this means is the individual pieces of data (name, team, are they safety trained, etc) are all separated by commas.  By doing this, it makes it easy to work with the data (we'll do this in the next notebook).  You can also open the file in Excel -- in fact, if you look at the file in Windows Explorer and open it, it will probably open in Excel."
